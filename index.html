            NT finally on steam.. release date set for JULY 4th. (Pending approval from Valve). Should be good to go.. the only bug is unfortunately it can't be run higher screen res then 1920 X 1200, otherwise the UI breaks and you can't click buttons cause the alignment goes funky (like offset by certain amount of pixels). SORRY FOR THAT BIG MONITOR PPL! Maybe run windowed on big ass monitors using 1920 X 1200 ?<br/>

                Hello everyone reading this... We just updated NT with a few new maps, and some weapon re-models.. and finally fixed the infamous "left-lean bug".. so now there is NO SHAME IN LEANING LEFT because you are now appropriately exposed like you would expect from a corner lean. So veteran players just need the PATCH INSTALLER.. and new players should get the FULL INSTALLER..<br/>

They're an amazing team and deserve a lot of respect for their skill, smarts, and teamwork. And a big thank you to ECO for going the distance. The final was 8-5, and although ZANSHI won, ECO put up a tremendous fight. The NINE SISTERS smile down from the unisphere, may they protect your neural pathways until post-combat recovery teams can salvage your consciousness. :)

                      <br/>
                      Hey all, we're releasing the NT Client Patch 1 this friday (10-23-2009) finally. It addresses a bunch of existing issues with the current release, and includes 7 new maps plus a night version of nt_dawn_ctg now called "nt_dusk_ctg." Hopefully we can get a changelog together and post it here or on the forums sometime soon. We've updated our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230318020240/http://www.moddb.com/mods/neotokyo/images" class="ver10" target="_blank">ModDB page</a> with some media showing the maps that are being included in the patch.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      On a random note, Gabe Newell and Erik Johnson of Valve Software came by my worksite the other day during their Australia trip (I work in New Zealand). So I managed to get a picture with Gabe when my boss was giving him a tour around the building. I'll do a little write up and show and tell in my next post.

                                We want to thank everyone that has downloaded and tried the mod, as well as thanking all the people that have put up servers. We'll be getting a game-info/manual thing up in the next couple of days hopefully. We realize it seems weird to release a game with no explanation of how to play it, but I guess that's how we roll!?! Anyways we'll correct that as soon as we can. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230318020240/http://files.getdropbox.com/u/892505/NTS%20Manual/Neotokyo%20Manual.pdf" class="ver10" target="_blank">There's an existing .pdf manual</a> but its pretty ghetto looking atm, so hopefully soonish we can tidy it up and get it online. :)<br/>

                                In the meantime you can check our <a href="neotokyo_noob_hints.html" class="ver10">NOOB HINTS</a> to hopefully help you decipher some of the complexity of the current gameplay. They've been up for a while, but the site was so hammered from release stuff that many of you probably never got a chance to see them. And of course we'll be trying to get the forums back up.<br/>

                                Some helpful information about the release...<br/>
                                - Neotokyo will be available for download at various sites and torrent.<br/>
                                - Download links will be released in our irc #neotokyo on gamesurge network during our release party. Then posted here and elsewhere.<br/>
                                - This first public release will contain 10 maps total ...all capture the ghost gametype.<br/>
                                - We recommend max 24 player slots. (9v9 to 12v12 are best as far as gameplay and flow). 32 players is fun but a bit spammy.<br/>
                                - Total size of the installer is about 900megs and unzipped is 2gigs.<br/>
                                - In order to run NEOTOKYO, you need to have any game that gives you the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230318020240/http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category2=16" class="ver10" target="_blank">source sdk base installed</a>.<br/>

These actually pop up between rounds during your class/weapon selection, but if you'd like to have a look at them before the game comes out, <a href="neotokyo_noob_hints.html" class="ver10">here you go</a>. They mainly cover our initial release gameplay type "capture the ghost," with some other tips and hints thrown in.

                                As far as development goes... the mod is essentially done. We've just got a few things to tidy up (double checking to make sure maps don't have problems like not enough spawns for large player counts, working with server admins to see if their admin tools are essentially compatible with NT, fine tuning a couple weapons for balance, etc..) We're also going to try and get the word out a little more aggressively by doing the usual PR stuffzzzzz.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Hopefully soon we can get a proper official tutorial going, and some announcements/info (max player recommendation, release map list, server stuff, last of the media, etc...) As soon as we've locked down these things, we'll post it up.

                                We're steadily attacking the last few things needed to be done before release, as well as ramping up our playtesting with larger player counts. 32 player NT is fun, but it's looking more like a game that's better somewhere near 16-20 (or 8v8, 10v10, etc.)<br/>
                                <br/>
                                We have 20 maps ready to go, but have decided on 10 for first release, maybe 11. The rest of the maps will be released with whatever patching needs to be done in the weeks after that. (bug fixing, fixing exploits, etc..)

We will be periodically showcasing new stuff which will include screens of our finished maps, weapons, player models, music tracks, and our Official NT Trailer ... All leading up to a release date announcement, so check back occasionally. :)<br/>

                              NEOTOKYO has been in production for 4 years, ... bascially 6 guys working as many weeknights and weekends as we could steal from our other responsibilies, making a game that we wanted to see made. It's been a labour of love, with lots of ups and downs, and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we've enjoyed making it.<br/>
                              Keep an eye out here in the coming months for the actual release info. And feel free to hang out with us on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230318020240/irc://irc.gamesurge.net/neotokyo" class="ver10">IRC</a><br/>
